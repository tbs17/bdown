      <description>Recently, the Data Science Team at AccuWeather has been promoting modular coding to better our coding skills and make our work more efficient. So what is modular coding? Per wikipedia, modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. To simply put, it means that anything you will need to use repeatedly should be written into a function or even a module that you can just easily call/import it.</description>

      <description>Google BigQuery and Azure Cloud are both powerful platforms to store data. Google BigQuery can process a couple TB of data within a couple minutes and you pay when you query, store and process. The detailed pricing is here.Azure SQL data base provides fast and convienient data for the first 32 GB/month at ~$5/month. The detailed pricing is here.Normally business intelligence analysts, database managers or data scientists access the two platforms from the two consoles separately.</description>

      <title>Run a Tensorflow Model in a Non GPU Supported Computer</title>

      <description>Recently, I’ve been playing with the deep learning python package ‘tensorflow’. I ran a simple linear regression model and had some success. Tensorflow is great with unstructured data and image recognization problem. Therefore, it usually runs better in a GPU supported computer. However, given my model is rather simple and won’t need to rely on too much image processing power like GPU. I did it on my windows 7 professional/10 machine and it predicted some values for me.</description>

      <title>My Journey to Data Science</title>

      <description>If you have viewed my bio, you probably noticed that I don’t have a science or engineering background, so how come I end up with data scientist? Well, it turns out that you don’t need a science or engineering background to become a data scientist! Here’s my personal trajectory. I think it’s highly reproducible:)
In Sep 2014, I was hired as a marketing research analyst by AccuWeather to work on AW’s new adventure: IoT or we call it emerging platform projects.</description>
