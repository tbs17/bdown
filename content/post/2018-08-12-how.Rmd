Recently, I've been playing with the deep learning python package 'tensorflow'. I ran a simple linear regression model and had some success. Tensorflow is great with unstructured data and image recognization problem. Therefore, it usually runs better in a GPU supported computer. However, given my model is rather simple and won't need to rely on too much image processing power like GPU. I did it on my windows 7 professional/10 machine and it predicted some values for me. Below are the detailed walk-throughs:

### step 1: install tensorflow package into python

I use Pycharm- [a Python IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to install tensforflow which is really easy. Go to the settings of Pycharm and navigate to the 'project interpreter' tab and click on '+' sign and search 'tensorflow' name and click 'install' button at the bottom.

### step 2: load a clean data and split it for training and testing data using sklearn

I'm loading a sample data set called ad_wx and convert some of my columns(feature candidates) to numeric data type for better building features for tensorflow. And you guessed it, 'AVG_weedday4','AVG_weedday5' and 'ad_unit' will become my 3 features in my simple tensorflow model. 

```{python eval=FALSE}
import pandas as pd

ad_wx=pd.read_csv('ad-wx.csv')
ad_wx['AVG_weedday4']=ad_wx['AVG_weedday4'].astype('int64')
ad_wx['AVG_weedday5']=ad_wx['AVG_weedday5'].astype('int64')
# ad_wx['clicks/impression']=ad_wx['clicks/impression'].astype('int64')
ad_wx['ad_unit']=ad_wx['ad_unit'].astype('str')
```


### step 3: build feature column and input function using tensorflow estimator API


### step 4: predict target values using CPU processing patch
