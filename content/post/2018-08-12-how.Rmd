Recently, I've been playing with the deep learning python package 'tensorflow'. I ran a simple linear regression model and had some success. Tensorflow is great with unstructured data and image recognization problem. Therefore, it usually runs better in a GPU supported computer. However, given my model is rather simple and won't need to rely on too much image processing power like GPU. I did it on my windows 7 professional/10 machine and it predicted some values for me. Below are the detailed walk-throughs:
