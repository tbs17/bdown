<p>Recently, I’ve been playing with the deep learning python package ‘tensorflow’. I ran a simple linear regression model and had some success. Tensorflow is great with unstructured data and image recognization problem. Therefore, it usually runs better in a GPU supported computer. However, given my model is rather simple and won’t need to rely on too much image processing power like GPU. I did it on my windows 7 professional/10 machine and it predicted some values for me. Below are the detailed walk-throughs:</p>

<h3>step 1: install tensorflow package into python</h3>
<p>I use Pycharm <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Python IDE</a> to install tensforflow which is really easy. Go to the settings of Pycharm and navigate to the ‘project interpreter’ tab and click on ‘+’ sign and search ‘tensorflow’ name and click ‘install’ button at the bottom.
