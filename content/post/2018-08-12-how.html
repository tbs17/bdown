<p>Recently, I’ve been playing with the deep learning python package ‘tensorflow’. I ran a simple linear regression model and had some success. Tensorflow is great with unstructured data and image recognization problem. Therefore, it usually runs better in a GPU supported computer. However, given my model is rather simple and won’t need to rely on too much image processing power like GPU. I did it on my windows 7 professional/10 machine and it predicted some values for me. Below are the detailed walk-throughs:</p>

<p>I use Pycharm- <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">a Python IDE</a> to install tensforflow which is really easy. Go to the settings of Pycharm and navigate to the ‘project interpreter’ tab and click on ‘+’ sign and search ‘tensorflow’ name and click ‘install’ button at the bottom.

<h3>step 2: load a clean data and split it for training and testing data using sklearn</h3>
<p>I’m loading a sample data set called ad_wx and convert some of my columns(feature candidates) to numeric data type for better building features for tensorflow. And you guessed it, ‘AVG_weedday4’,‘AVG_weedday5’ and ‘ad_unit’ will become my 3 features in my simple tensorflow model.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import pandas as pd
ad_wx=pd.read_csv(&#39;ad-wx.csv&#39;)
ad_wx[&#39;AVG_weedday4&#39;]=ad_wx[&#39;AVG_weedday4&#39;].astype(&#39;int64&#39;)
ad_wx[&#39;AVG_weedday5&#39;]=ad_wx[&#39;AVG_weedday5&#39;].astype(&#39;int64&#39;)
# ad_wx[&#39;clicks/impression&#39;]=ad_wx[&#39;clicks/impression&#39;].astype(&#39;int64&#39;)
ad_wx[&#39;ad_unit&#39;]=ad_wx[&#39;ad_unit&#39;].astype(&#39;str&#39;)</code></pre>
